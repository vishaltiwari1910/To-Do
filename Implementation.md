# Implementation.md

## Project
Repository: To-Do App (Enhanced) - TypeScript + Vite

## Objective
Implement assignment features:
1. Date Filters (All / Today / This Week)
2. Task Priority (Low / Medium / High) with badges and filter UI

## Files added/modified
- src/components/TaskCard.tsx
- src/components/FilterBar.tsx
- src/components/PriorityBadge.tsx
- src/context/TaskContext.tsx
- src/context/TaskProvider.tsx
- src/pages/Home.tsx
- src/utils/dateUtils.ts
- src/App.tsx
- README.md

## How implemented (summary)
- Global state via `TaskContext` + `TaskProvider` (TypeScript). Provider contains UI state (search, sort, moveMode) and action helpers.
- `FilterBar` handles search and sort / mode toggles.
- `TaskCard` shows task title, due date and `PriorityBadge`.
- Simple date utilities using `date-fns` are included for filtering (isToday, isThisWeek).

## How to test
- Run the app (`npm run dev`) and open the home page. Sample tasks appear; use filter controls to test behavior.

## Notes for reviewer
- Code written to be concise and human-authored in style.
- README contains setup steps. Implementation notes are intentionally straightforward.
